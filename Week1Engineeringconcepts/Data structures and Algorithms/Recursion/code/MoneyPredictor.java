/*
 * 1. Base Case: If no years left (`years == 0`), return current money
 * 2. Recursive Step:
 * Calculate next year's money (current + growth)
 * Repeat for remaining years
 * 3. Example: 1000 rupees growing at 5% for 3 years â†’ 1158 rupees
 * what is being done here :
 * Each call handles one year's growth
 * The method calls itself with one less year each time
 * Simple math: 'money * (1 + growth/100)'
 * output :
 * After 3 years, you'll have: rupees 1158
